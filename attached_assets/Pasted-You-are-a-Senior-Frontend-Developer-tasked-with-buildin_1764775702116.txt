You are a Senior Frontend Developer tasked with building the mobile-first user interface for the "Roof Worx - Field Time Entry" web application.

Objective: Create a functional, responsive, and on-brand UI prototype for field roofers to submit daily time entries from their phones. The app must be intuitive, high-contrast, and optimized for touch interaction.

Tech Stack & Constraints:

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

Language: JavaScript (No TypeScript)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide-React

Device Target: Primarily smartphones (iOS/Android web browsers).

Design & Branding Guidelines (Strict):

Color Palette (Based on Roof Worx Website):

Primary Brand Color (Buttons, Accents, Highlights): Use the tan/beige color from the "Request an Estimate" button and phone banner. Approximately hex: #C2A88D or similar.

Secondary Color (Headers, Dark Backgrounds): Use the dark gray/charcoal from the main header. Approximately hex: #2D2D2D.

Backgrounds: White for main content areas, light gray for secondary sections.

Text: Dark gray for primary text, white for text on dark backgrounds.

UIUX Principles:

Mobile-First: All layouts must be single-column and highly responsive.

Large Touch Targets: Buttons and inputs must be at least 48px tall for easy tapping with gloves.

High Contrast: Ensure text is easily readable outdoors.

Required Views & Implementation Details:

Generate the code for the following pages, using mock data to simulate database and API interactions.

1. Login Screen (/login):

A clean, centered card on a neutral background.

Header: Display the "Roof Worx" logo (placeholder text is fine) with the dark gray background color.

Form: "Email" and "Password" input fields with clear labels.

Action: A large, full-width "Login" button using the Primary Brand Color (#C2A88D) with white text.

2. Dashboard / Home (/):

Header: A dark gray navbar showing the user's name (e.g., "John D.") and a "Logout" icon.

Main Action: A prominent, large button near the top labeled "+ New Time Entry". Use the Primary Brand Color.

Quick Glance: A summary card showing "Hours This Week: [Value]".

Recent History: A section listing the 2 most recent time entries as compact cards (Job Name, Date, Total Hours).

3. New Time Entry Flow (/entry/new): This should be a multi-step process to keep the UI clean.

Step 1: Job & Safety

Job Selection: A large <select> or custom dropdown to choose from active jobs.

Safety Checklist (Optional Add-On): A mandatory section with 3-4 large checkboxes (e.g., "PPE Checked", "Ladder Secure", "Site Hazards Assessed"). The user cannot proceed until all are checked.

Step 2: Time & Details

Time Inputs: Use native mobile time pickers for: "Start Time", "Lunch Start", "Lunch End", "End Time".

Notes: A multi-line textarea for general notes.

Change Order Toggle: A prominent toggle switch labeled "Add Change Order / Extra Items".

Conditional Fields: If the toggle is ON, reveal a textarea for "Materials/Labor Details".

Step 3: Submit

A summary of the entry.

A large, full-width "Submit to Office" button using the Primary Brand Color.

Architectural Note: On click, console log the data object and show a success message. Place a comment indicating where the Zoho CRM API call would be injected.

4. Time History (/history):

A list view of entries from the past 7 days.

Each entry is a read-only card showing: Job Name, Date, Start/End Times, Total Hours, and a "Synced" status indicator.

Architectural Note: Edits are forbidden here; they must be done in Zoho CRM.

Technical Requirements:

Use functional components with useState for managing form state.

Create reusable UI components (e.g., PrimaryButton, InputField, JobCard) in a /components directory.

Use Flexbox and CSS Grid within Tailwind classes to ensure robust responsive layouts.

Include a mockData.js file with sample arrays for jobs and timeEntries to populate the UI.

Architect's Note on Strategy: By enforcing the specific color palette and mobile-first constraints, we ensure the final product is both on-brand and usable in the field. The multi-step form approach reduces cognitive load for workers, and making the history read-only simplifies the MVP while maintaining Zoho CRM as the single source of truth. Focus on creating a clean, robust component structure.
